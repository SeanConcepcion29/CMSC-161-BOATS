# BOATS: Boat in Ocean - Animation and Terrain Simulation

Boat in Ocean - Animation and Terrain Simulation‚Äù or ‚ÄúBOATS‚Äù is an interactive simulation highlighting WebGL capabilities to render animations and objects. BOATS showcase a boat in an ocean diorama where the user is able to use the camera to zoom in/out, rotate the world, change the time of day, and play an animation on the world. The simulation also presents realistic and dynamic lighting on the cubic environment.


## üåä System Features

### 1. 3D Models
- High-quality voxel models of a boat and ocean.
- Models are optimized for smooth real-time rendering and interaction.

### 2. User Interaction
- **Zoom in/out**: Use the **scroll wheel**.
- **Rotate world**: Use the **arrow keys**.
- **Time of day control**: Adjust using the **slider**.

### 3. Lighting
- Realistic **diffuse** and **specular lighting** effects.
- **Dynamic sunlight**: Changes angle and color to simulate a day-night cycle, affecting the boat and ocean appearance.

### 4. Textures
- Ocean surface is made of **colored voxels** (cubes).
- Water color changes based on wave **height** for a realistic depth effect.
- Boat uses colored voxels as well.

### 5. Animation
- The ocean is **animated** using dynamic voxel height to mimic wave motion.

### 6. User Manual
- A **video tutorial** demonstrates how to use the application.
- **Step-by-step instructions** for interaction and features are included.
